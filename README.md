Neuron Library - Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on ROScube
=============================================================================

Neuron Library is the API library for ADLINK products, such as ROScube-I and
ROScube-X. Neuron Library provides a common API of C++ bindings to Python to
interface with the peripheral IO of the controller. With a structured and sane
API where port index matches the platform that you are on, it's easier for
developers and sensor manufacturers to map their sensors & actuators on top
of supported hardware and to allow control of low level communication protocol
by high level languages & constructs.

Supported Hardware
================
